Pretty much everything is in this format, indexes, table data, etc. Those pages are 8K in size, each page will have the rows, or index tuples and a fixed header. The pages are just bytes in files and they are read and cached in the buffer pool.\n\nTo read page 0, for example, you would call read on offset 0 for 8192 bytes, To read page 1 that is another read system call from offset 8193 for 8192, page 7 is offset 57,345 for 8192 and so on. \n\nIf table is 100 pages stored a file, to do a full table scan, we would be making 100 system calls, each system call had an overhead (I talk about all of that in my OS course). \n\nThe enhancement in Postgres 17 is to combine I/Os you can specify how much IO to combine, so technically while possible you can scan that entire table in one system call doesn‚Äôt mean its always a good idea of course and Ill talk about that. \n\nThis also seems to included a vectorized I/O, with preadv system call which takes an array of offsets and lengths for random reads. \n\nThe challenge will become how to not read too much, say I‚Äôm doing a seq scan to find something, I read page 0 and found it and quit I don‚Äôt need to read any more pages. With this feature I might read 10 pages in one I/O and pull all its content, put in shared buffers only to find my result in the first page (essentially wasting disk bandwidth, memory etc) \n\nIt is going to be interesting to balance this out. \n\nGood work Pg team!

Ghising stated that the suggestions made by the Girish Chandra Lal-led commission formed by the government to resolve the dispute over the facilities used by industries during the load shedding period and the corresponding charges cannot be implemented as is. Speaking on Kantipur Television&apos;s weekly program &apos;Fireside&apos;, Ghising argued that implementing these suggestions would not be legal as there is no rule to issue bills on an hourly basis.\nGhising also stated that the complaints filed against him with the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority are baseless. He refuted the allegations that the revenue was lost because the projects had signed power purchase agreements with the NEA without the approval of the Electricity Regulatory Commission in 2075, even though they were required to obtain approval from the commission before signing such agreements. Ghising informed that the NEA, which has set a target of providing electricity to all parts of the country by next year, will now focus on providing quality electricity and expanding the transmission line.\nOn this episode of Fireside, Journalist Rupesh Shrestha has talked to Ghising on wide aspects including topics such as allegations of creating pressure on industries using his popularity and political patronage, his relationship with Prime Minister KP Oli, and the future plans of the NEA. Interview also deals on the plans of power trade with India and Bangladesh as well. \n\nKantipur TV HD ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§£ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ Youtube ‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•à ‡§π‡•á‡§∞‡•ç‡§® ‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞‡•á ‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§™‡•ç‡§§ ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§® ‡§π‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§∏‡§Å‡§ó Youtube ‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§ú‡•ã‡§°‡§ø‡§®‡•Å‡§π‡•ã‡§∏‡•ç : \nhttps://www.youtube.com/kantipurtvhd?sub_confirmation=1\nClick here to Download our Apps: http://www.kantipurtv.com/apps\nVisit our Website: http://www.kantipurtv.com/\nFacebook: https://www.faceabook.com/kantipurtvhd/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/kantipurtvhd\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kantipurtvhd\n\nKeywords:\n Fireside, Rupesh Shrestha","viewCount":73102,"lengthSeconds":4522,"watchProgress":34.624663,"timeWatched":1724222488552,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"l4beJQ7uGaXHhUDT","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

This course is designed such that beginners, programmers with coding experience in some other language and non programmers are able to follow along.
